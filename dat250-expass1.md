## Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1 

The first few points in the installation went quitle smoothly, as I had previously installed **JDK**, **IntelliJ** and **Git**. With **Maven** however, I encountered some minor problems. Like with **JAVA_HOME**. But after some googling and small changes, I got it to work. I verified that all was working with **%JAVA_HOME%**, **mvn --version** and **mvn -v**. 

The next step was to setup **Heroku**, which took a bit of time, but following the guide went relatively flawlessly. I compared my output to the output in the guide throughout, making sure I had done everything correctly. I had some problems with the database and **Postgres** section, which was again solved by googling and some tweaking. I finally got it to work and got the correct result when running the command **heroku open db**. As that that was the last step, I had gotten everything to work as it should.
